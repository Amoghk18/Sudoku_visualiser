# Sudoku_visualiser
Sudoku is a challenging game of logic. Here we use pygame module for visualisation of sudoku grid.
## How to play it?
You can put a value as a temperary number by just clicking on that particular box and entering a number, if you feel that the number entered by you is correct go ahead and hit enter to check if it's right or wrong. If it's right it will accept the value and if it's wrong you will see a red "X" at the bottom.
<br><br>If you want to remove the temperary number then click on the respective box and hit "Del" key, if you want to replace it with a new value then click on the respective box and enter the new number.
<br><br>That is how you play this game!
